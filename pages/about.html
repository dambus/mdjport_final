        I'm always ready to dig into new technologies and challenges, exploring
        new opportunities. I like to learn new, interesting stuff, by need or by
        curiosity. Always experimenting, always trying out something new, and
        I'm never bored. Creativity is my curse and blessing. Curse for doing
        strict boundaries jobs, but blessing for everything else.

        Life would be so empty without music. Mostly listening to rock and
        variations. Sometimes even harder stuff.Playing guitar as a hobby. Not
        super good at it but hey, that's why it is a hobby

        If wine is beverage of choice for Gods, coffee is the same, but for us
        mortals. At least IMO. Brings life into me every morning, and probbably
        making me mortal one day...

        People say I'm a great listener, and in addition to that, I can find a
        common language with most of my interlocutors. It's a winning
        combination.

        I like playing computer games. Doing that for a long time and I think
        it's a good way to blow off some steam. Of course moderate practice is
        recommended. Unless you're a PRO, then go ahaed and knock yourself out.
